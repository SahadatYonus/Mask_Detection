# Mask_Detection

This is my final project of Lighthouse Labs. 

## About
The model is a mask detection model. I used Convolutional Nueral Networks (CNN) to accomplish it. The data preprocessing and training took quite a bit of long time. I trained the model using different `layers` and `activation function`, and it took me 5 training to rwach the accuracy of 96.625%. At the end, I converted the model to a `CoreML` file which I then ised it in my iOS application-will release soon. 

## Dataset 
During my research for a dataset, I found many of them in Kaggle. However, there was one with 7553 images with two classes **with_mask** and **without_mask**. You can find the dataset [here](https://www.kaggle.com/omkargurav/face-mask-dataset).
